# Multi-Object-Tracking
Repository for the course "Multi-Object Tracking for Automotive Systems" at EDX Chalmers University of Technology

Note: I have completed all assignments in the course and obfuscated key function by using encrypted p files, since it is not
allowed to release solution publicly on github, according to EDX policy. Any interest in implementation details will be discussed
privately.

## Home-Assignment 01 (SA2) - Single-Object Tracking in Clutter
Implementation of the following algorithms:
- [x] Nearest Neighbors Filter (NN)
- [x] Probabilistic Data Association Filter (PDA)
- [x] Gaussian Sum Filter (GSF)

The main class is located at [SA2/singleobjectracker.m](./SA2/singleobjectracker.m)

Simulations can be done using  [SA2/simulation1.mlx](./SA2/simulation1.mlx)
