classdef hypothesisReduction
    %HYPOTHESISREDUCTION is class containing different hypotheses reduction
    %method 
    %PRUNE: prune hypotheses with small weights.
    %CAP:   keep M hypotheses with the highest weights and discard the rest. 
    %MERGE: merge similar hypotheses in the sense of small Mahalanobis
    %       distance.
    %
    % Note: Usually, one need to re-normalise the weights after pruning/capping; 
    %       however, this is not done inside the functions you are going to implement.
